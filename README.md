## Team Members:

## Ideas 
Shopping list app that focuses on price comparison.

Require user authentication:
Roles:
Parent/Admin Role
Child/User Role

For example, parent can choose a snack list and the child can pick specific foods off of that list and the parent will buy it

Different sections depending on type or genre. An example with food would be dairy, meat, bread, etc.

Or different aisle numbers for types

Giving the user a way to group their items together

Having the ability to sort items by store

Focusing on price comparison part, depending on how we set up our schema, we can have a method that compares prices of a certain food item and returns the least expensive one

Having a budget feature either for special categories or by store

Having a special item timer, for example, you are only allowed to buy a sugary treat once a week or once a month

## Base Application Should
1. Contain a master level and a detail category
2. Allow access to User Accounts
3. Have the ability to add favorite/wishlist items, which will be tied to the associated user's account
4. Be deployed using Heroku

## Coding Standards
- The .eslintrc that comes with the project needs to be used within the project, every team member using the same exact one
- Don't merge your own pull requests
- Always pull down before pushing
- Push to your forked repo(origin) and merge into the final project repository. Then ask another team member to go over your pull request
- Always pull from upstream master
- If two members are working on the same file, make sure you're communicating to minimize merge conflicts
